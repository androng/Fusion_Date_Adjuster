 Modifies the modification date of the stitched GoPro video files to match the time they were taken, not the time that they were stitched. This makes these videos group together on the same date with the GoPro photos in Google Photos. (GoPro Fusion Studio saves "Date taken" for photos. Fusion Studio doesn't preserve "Date taken" for videos.)  
 
 Takes date from unstitched files with names like GPFR0089.MP4 and changes the date on stitched files with names like  like VIDEO_0089.mp4

 Optionally renames stiched files with original date in the filename 
 
 Usage:
